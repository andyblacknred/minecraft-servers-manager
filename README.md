# üéÆ Minecraft Server Manager

A lightweight, script-based manager for running and maintaining your own Minecraft server.

It automates the process of preparing the environment, downloading the correct server version, generating configuration files, and creating backups ‚Äî all through clean and modular batch scripts.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Automatically downloads and caches `server.jar` for your selected version
- Generates and updates key configuration files (`server.properties`, etc.)
- Prepares the world folder structure on first launch
- Creates timestamped backups with version tracking
- Uses a central `config.ini` for easy customization

## üíª Platform Support

| Platform     | Status   | Scripts Folder         |
|--------------|----------|------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Windows 11 | Tested   | `src/scripts/win11/`   |
| ‚úÖ Ubuntu     | Tested   | `src/scripts/ubuntu/`  |
| ‚ö† WSL/macOS  | Untested | Might require tweaks   |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All logic is separated per OS and stored in platform-specific folders.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Download or clone** this repository.
2. **Edit `config.ini`** to define:
   - Minecraft version
   - World name
   - RAM allocation
   - Port, etc.
3. **3. Run `start.bat` (from src/scripts/win11/) or `start.sh` (from src/scripts/ubuntu/)**:
   - Downloads correct `server.jar` version (if missing)
   - Prepares build folder and configs
   - Launches the server
4. **Run `backup.bat|sh`** anytime to create a snapshot of your world.
5. **Run `versions.bat|sh`** to see a list of official Minecraft versions (including snapshots).

---

## ‚ö† IMPORTANT

**Do NOT run 'helper/' scripts directly.**  
They require BASE_DIR and other environment variables to be loaded first ‚Äî which is done automatically by `start.bat` or `start.sh`.

### ‚úÖ Instead, always use the main entry point scripts:

- `start.bat` (or `start.sh` for 'ubuntu' version)
- `backup.bat|sh`

These entry points handle environment setup and ensure correct execution context.

---

## ‚ö† WARNING

**It is NOT recommended to edit `config.ini`, `server.properties`, or other config files in the `src/config/` folder after a world has been created** (i.e., once the folder `build/<WORLD_NAME>/` exists).

Changing world parameters such as:
- `WORLD_NAME`
- `VERSION`
- `PORT`

...may lead to unexpected behavior, corruption, or runtime errors.

> If you still choose to proceed ‚Äî make sure you know what you're doing.  
> In any case, **always run `backup.bat` (Windows) or `backup.sh` (Ubuntu) before making any changes to the files in `src/config/`**.
